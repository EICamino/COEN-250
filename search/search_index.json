Why is the identification of risks and vulnerabilities to assets so important in risk management? Risk identification (vulnerability), assessment (exposure), and control (reduce to acceptable) Quiz 2 According to Sun Tzu, what two key understandings must you achieve to be successful in battle? Know yourself (standing), know the enemy(threats). Quiz 3 Who is responsible for risk management in an organization? Which community of interest usually takes the lead in information security risk management? Each community of interest Information security community Quiz 4 In risk management strategies, why must periodic review be part of the process? Ensure effective, always neglected. Quiz 5 Why do networking components need more examination from an information security perspective than from a systems development perspective? Often the focal point of attacks, considered special rather than combined with others. Quiz 6 What value does an automated asset inventory system have during risk identification? Identify system elements that make up hardware, software, and network components calculation of possible loss and protections of cost in risk management Quiz 7 What information attribute is often of great value for local networks that use static addressing? IP Address With dynamic addressing, the MAC Address is more useful. Quiz 8 When devising a classification scheme for systems components, is it more important that the asset identification list be comprehensive or mutually exclusive? Both are important as depending upon the organization\u2019s list priority and classification. Quiz 9 What\u2019s the difference between an asset\u2019s ability to generate revenue and its ability to generate profit? Revenue is the recognition of income from an activity supported by the system. Profit is the amount of revenue that exceeds operating costs. Some systems may cost more to operate than they contribute to revenue. Quiz 10 What are vulnerabilities? How do you identify them? Specific avenues that threat agents can exploit to attack an information asset. Analyzing all components of an information systems and evaluating the risk to each component identify the vulnerabilities. Quiz 11 What is competitive disadvantage? Why has it emerged as a factor? A competitive disadvantage occurs when a company falls behind the competition in its ability to maintain the highly responsive services required in today's marketplaces. This is a factor because almost all organizations have an IT system in this day and time. Therefore, organizations need to obtain or improve their IT systems to avoid falling behind all others. Quiz 12 What five strategies for controlling risk are described in this chapter? Defend- The defend control strategy attempts to prevent the exploitation of the vulnerability. Transfer- The transfer control strategy attempts to shift risk to other assets, other processes, or other organizations. Mitigate- The mitigate control strategy attempts to reduce the impact caused by the exploitation of vulnerability through planning and preparation. Accept- The accept control strategy is the choice to do nothing to protect a vulnerability and to accept the outcome of its exploitation. Terminate - The terminate control strategy directs the organization to avoid those business activities that introduce uncontrollable risks. Quiz 13 Describe the defense strategy for controlling risk. List and describe the three common methods. The defend control strategy attempts to prevent the exploitation of the vulnerability. This Is the preferred approach, and is accomplished by means of countering threats, removing vulnerabilities from assets, limiting access to assets, and adding protective safeguards. There are three common methods used to defend: - Application of policy - Education and training - Application of technology Quiz 14 Describe the transference strategy for controlling risk. Describe how outsourcing can be used for this purpose. The transfer strategy is the control approach that attempts to shift risk to other assets, other processes, or other organizations. This may be accomplished by rethinking how services are offered, revising deployment models, outsourcing to other organizations, purchasing insurance, or implementing service contracts with providers. Outsourcing allows an organization to transfer the risk associated with the management of complex systems to another organization that has experience in dealing with those risks. One of the benefits of outsourcing is that the service provider is responsible for disaster recovery when recovery efforts are needed. Quiz 15 Describe the mitigation strategy for controlling risk. What three planning approaches are discussed in the text as opportunities to mitigate risk? The mitigate strategy is the control approach that attempts to reduce the impact caused bythe exploitation of vulnerability through planning and preparation. Mitigation begins withthe early detection that an attack is in progress and the ability of the organization to respondquickly, efficiently, and effectively.This approach requires the creation of three types of plans: the incident response plan, thedisaster recovery plan, and the business continuity plan. Each of these plans depends on theability to detect and respond to an attack as quickly as possible and relies on the existenceand quality of the other plans. - Incident Response Plan (IRP):Defines the actions an organization can and perhapsshould take while an incident is in progress. The IR plan focuses on intelligence gather-ing, information analysis, coordinated decision making, and urgent, concrete actions. - Disaster recovery plan (DRP):Includes the entire spectrum of activities used to preparefor and recover from an incident. The DR plan focuses more on preparations completedbefore and actions taken after the incident. - Business Continuity Plan (BCP):Encompasses the continuation of business activitiesif a catastrophic event occurs.The BC plan includes planning the steps necessary toensure the continuation of the organization when the scope or scale of a disaster exceedsthe ability of the DR plan to restore operations. Quiz 16 How is an incident response plan different from a disaster recovery plan? The DR plan focuses more on preparations completed before and actions taken for disasters \u2014often escalated incidents; to reestablish operations at the primary site. The IR plan focuses onIncident Response: intelligence gathering, information analysis, coordinated decision making,and urgent, concrete actions taken while an incident is occurring. Quiz 17 What is risk appetite? Explain why it varies among organizations. Quantity and nature of risk that organizations are willing to accept as trade-offs of security with accessibility. Risk appetite varies from organization to organization because different organizations main-tain different balances between the expense of controlling vulnerabilities and the losses possi-ble if these vulnerabilities were exploited. The key for each organization is to find the balancein its decision-making processes and in its feasibility analyses, therefore assuring that an or-ganization\u2019s risk appetite is based on experience and facts and not on ignorance or wishfulthinking Quiz 18 What is a cost-benefit analysis? Cost benefit analysis is the formal decision-making process used by an organization to evaluate whether or not the benefit gained from a given project is worth the expense its undertaking incurs. Quiz 19 What is single loss expectancy? What is annualized loss expectancy? A single loss expectancy is the value associated with the most likely loss from an attack. It is a calculation based on the value of the asset and the expected percentage of loss that would occur from a single occurrence of a particular attack. Annual loss expectancy is the expected loss from exploitation of a vulnerability for a specific information asset over the course of a year. It is calculated by multiplying the single loss expectancy for a particular information asset by the annualized rate of occurrence. Quiz 20 What is residual risk? Even when vulnerabilities have been controlled as much as possible, there is often still some risk that has not been completely removed, shifted, or planned for. This remainder is called residual risk.","title":"Week 8 - Risk Management"},{"location":"Week-8/#week-8-risk-management","text":"","title":"Week 8 - Risk Management"},{"location":"Week-8/#summarize","text":"","title":"Summarize"},{"location":"Week-8/#quiz","text":"","title":"Quiz"},{"location":"Week-8/#quiz-1","text":"What is risk management?

List and describe the three common methods. The defend control strategy attempts to prevent the exploitation of the vulnerability. This Is the preferred approach, and is accomplished by means of countering threats, removing vulnerabilities from assets, limiting access to assets, and adding protective safeguards. There are three common methods used to defend: - Application of policy - Education and training - Application of technology","title":"Quiz 13"},{"location":"Week-8/#quiz-14","text":"Describe the transference strategy for controlling risk. Describe how outsourcing can be used for this purpose. The transfer strategy is the control approach that attempts to shift risk to other assets, other processes, or other organizations. This may be accomplished by rethinking how services are offered, revising deployment models, outsourcing to other organizations, purchasing insurance, or implementing service contracts with providers. Outsourcing allows an organization to transfer the risk associated with the management of complex systems to another organization that has experience in dealing with those risks. One of the benefits of outsourcing is that the service provider is responsible for disaster recovery when recovery efforts are needed.","title":"Quiz 14"},{"location":"Week-8/#quiz-15","text":"Describe the mitigation strategy for controlling risk. What three planning approaches are discussed in the text as opportunities to mitigate risk? The mitigate strategy is the control approach that attempts to reduce the impact caused bythe exploitation of vulnerability through planning and preparation. Mitigation begins withthe early detection that an attack is in progress and the ability of the organization to respondquickly, efficiently, and effectively.This approach requires the creation of three types of plans: the incident response plan, thedisaster recovery plan, and the business continuity plan. Each of these plans depends on theability to detect and respond to an attack as quickly as possible and relies on the existenceand quality of the other plans. - Incident Response Plan (IRP):Defines the actions an organization can and perhapsshould take while an incident is in progress. The IR plan focuses on intelligence gather-ing, information analysis, coordinated decision making, and urgent, concrete actions. - Disaster recovery plan (DRP):Includes the entire spectrum of activities used to preparefor and recover from an incident. The DR plan focuses more on preparations completedbefore and actions taken after the incident. - Business Continuity Plan (BCP):Encompasses the continuation of business activitiesif a catastrophic event occurs.The BC plan includes planning the steps necessary toensure the continuation of the organization when the scope or scale of a disaster exceedsthe ability of the DR plan to restore operations.","title":"Quiz 15"},{"location":"Week-8/#quiz-16","text":"How is an incident response plan different from a disaster recovery plan?
